# HIIT-Training-Timer-App
It is basically an app created in Kotlin, where one can store different durations like workout1 time, rest1 time, then workout 2 and rest2  durations. Timer runs and notifies the user at the end of each activity by an alarming sound.  This app is useful in a sense that there is no need to start and stop timer after each activity which is basically a provided feature in Android OS. 


This is a very basic version and still a work in progress. Target is to add any number of activity and display them on the main activity using a recycler View. Exception handling needs to be better.
